> Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm is also known as the shortest path algorithm. It is an algorithm used to find the shortest path between nodes of the graph. The algorithm creates the tree of the shortest paths from the starting source vertex from all other points in the graph. It differs from the minimum spanning tree as the shortest distance between two vertices may not be included in all the vertices of the graph. The algorithm works by building a set of nodes that have a minimum distance from the source. Here, Dijkstra's algorithm uses a greedy approach to solve the problem and find the best solution.

    for(int k=0;k<6;k++) 
    {
        if(Tset[k]==false && distance[k]<=minimum)      
        {
            minimum=distance[k];
            ind=k;
        }
    }
    return ind;
}

void DijkstraAlgo(int graph[6][6],int src) // adjacency matrix
